# Community-Driven Security-Focused Linux Kernel

This repository represents a community-driven effort to maintain a security-hardened Linux kernel with state-of-the-art CI/CD practices.

## üéØ Mission

To democratize Linux kernel development by:
- Providing automated security analysis and hardening
- Enabling community contributions with rigorous validation
- Delivering pre-built, security-hardened kernel packages
- Maintaining transparency in all security patches and decisions

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Automated Security Scanning
- **Static Analysis**: Coccinelle, Sparse, cppcheck, clang-analyzer
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Trivy, OSV Scanner
- **Hardening Verification**: kernel-hardening-checker
- **Runtime Protection**: KASAN, KCSAN, KTSAN builds

### Security-First Development
- Mandatory security checks on all PRs
- Automated detection of dangerous patterns
- Security-sensitive change highlighting
- Daily vulnerability scans

### Hardened Defaults
Our builds include:
- Full KASLR implementation
- Hardened memory allocators
- Stack protectors
- Control Flow Integrity (CFI)
- Memory initialization
- Speculation mitigations

## üì¶ Pre-Built Packages

Every commit to main automatically builds and releases:
- **DEB packages**: For Debian/Ubuntu systems (amd64, arm64)
- **RPM packages**: For Fedora/RHEL systems (x86_64, aarch64)

Find releases at: [Releases Page](../../releases)

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

### Build Matrix
- **Architectures**: x86_64, arm64/aarch64
- **Compilers**: GCC, Clang/LLVM
- **Configurations**: defconfig, allmodconfig, tinyconfig
- **Sanitizers**: KASAN, KCSAN, KTSAN, KCOV

### Automated Workflows
1. **Package Building**: Automatic DEB/RPM generation
2. **Security Analysis**: Continuous vulnerability scanning
3. **Testing**: Build tests, boot tests, KUnit tests
4. **PR Validation**: Style checks, security checks, build verification
5. **Documentation**: Automatic docs generation

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Every PR undergoes:
- Automated style checking (checkpatch.pl)
- Security pattern detection
- Multi-architecture build testing
- Commit message validation
- Documentation requirements check

### Contribution Guidelines
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Ensure commits are signed-off (`git commit -s`)
4. Follow kernel coding style
5. Submit PR with clear description

### Commit Message Format
```

## üîí Security Policy

Report vulnerabilities via GitHub Security Advisories. We take security seriously and aim for:
- < 24 hour initial response
- < 7 day patch for critical issues
- Full disclosure after patch release

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

### Using Pre-Built Packages

```bash
# Download latest release
curl -L https://github.com/einyx/linux/releases/latest/download/linux-image-<version>-<arch>.deb

# Install (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo dpkg -i linux-image-*.deb

# Install (Fedora/RHEL)
sudo rpm -i kernel-*.rpm
```

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/einyx/linux.git
cd linux

# Configure with security hardening
make defconfig
./scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh .config kernel/configs/hardening.config

# Build
make -j$(nproc)
make modules_install
make install
```

## üìà Roadmap

- [ ] Real-time kernel (RT) patches integration
- [ ] Automated fuzzing infrastructure
- [ ] Performance regression testing
- [ ] Kernel live patching support
- [ ] Security backports automation
- [ ] Container-optimized builds

## üåü Why This Fork?

Traditional kernel development can be:
- Difficult for newcomers to contribute
- Lacking in automated security validation
- Missing pre-built hardened configurations
- Slow to adopt modern CI/CD practices

This fork addresses these issues by providing a modern, automated, security-focused development environment welcoming to all contributors.
